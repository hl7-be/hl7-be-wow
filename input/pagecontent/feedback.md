### Feedback

HL7 Belgium FHIR Implementation Guides use the following feedback mechanism:


* Feedback for an Implementation Guide is entered as an issue to that implementation guide's source. This allows one centralized view of all issues, facilitates planning and promotes transparency.


* When the feedback feature is enabled, each section header of the Implementation Guide has a link to provide feedback on that section:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}feedback-1.png" alt="drawing" width="500" align="center"/></div>
<br clear="all"/>

* To facilitate feedback, even for users without a GitHub account, the feedback is provided via an online form which registers the issue in GitHub.
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}feedback-2.png" alt="drawing" width="500" align="center"/></div>
<br clear="all"/>

* The issues are shown in a dashboard, for planning and tracking:
  * Sandbox/ incoming issues are those that have been submitted but they are not planned
  * To Do issues are accepted to be addressed
  * Work in Progress
  * Done

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}feedback-3.png" alt="drawing" width="500" align="center"/></div>
<br clear="all"/>


* The Implementation Guide contains a link to the issues dashboard.
